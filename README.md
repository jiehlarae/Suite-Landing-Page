## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

Working on this project helped me to refine several key concepts. Here's a snippet of code that Iâ€™m particularly proud of:

```html
<h1>A <span>super <span class="curvedLine">solution</span></span> for your <span>business.</span></h1>
```

```css
.curvedLine::before {
  content: '';
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  background: url(./assets/pattern-curved-line-1.svg) no-repeat center;
  background-size: cover;
  width: 100%;
  height: 80%;
  top: -20px;
}
```

### Continued Development

Moving forward, I plan to focus on enhancing my proficiency with responsive design and improving my skills in CSS Grid and Flexbox for building more complex layouts.
